# About Me
I've been a devoted Thin Lizzy fan for over 40 years. It all started back in the mid-80s when I received the Fighting album. At the time, someone close to me suggested I switch from what they deemed "cock rock" to something more authentic. Little did I know, that album would completely change my musical journey.

I was just 14 when I stumbled upon Thin Lizzy, and their music opened up a whole new world for me. Discovering that such a powerful hard rock band hailed from Ireland was mind-blowing. Even more intriguing was the fact that the band's frontman, Phil Lynott, was black and had roots in my mother's hometown of Crumlin.

This connection to Crumlin added a deeper layer to my admiration for Thin Lizzy. Years later, when my family discussed relocating back to Crumlin, I initially resisted. By then, I was 16 and deeply entrenched in the local heavy metal scene. In the 80s, our community was divided into distinct subcultures - rockers, mods, punks - and I firmly identified with the rocker group.

Our rocker group was a diverse mix of individuals from the neighborhood, all involved in rock bands playing various instruments. We embraced different styles within the rocker world, from trash to cock to classic rock. Yet, one thing we all shared was a profound love for Thin Lizzy. Their music was a constant source of inspiration for us, and we often jammed to their songs.

When I discovered that our potential new home was on Leighlin Road, Philip Lynott's childhood stomping ground, my perspective shifted entirely. I was packed and ready to move within a day, surprising everyone in my family with my sudden enthusiasm.

## From Leghlin on

After moving into Crumlin on Leighlin Road, I awoke from my first night's sleep to the surreal realization that Philip Lynott's childhood home faced mine. It felt strange to blast Thin Lizzy's music, imagining his family might hear it, especially considering he had only passed away three years prior.

This unease dissolved one evening when my father struck up a conversation with Philip's uncle, Timmy, at the Four Roads Pub. Sadly, Timmy has since passed away, may he rest in peace. Upon hearing about my dilemma with playing music, Timmy, a wise and kind soul, responded, "Tell him to play it loud and proud, it'd be great to hear his music again."

Through Timmy and his wife, I forged a remarkable friendship with Philip's mother Philomeana too, one that granted me unique opportunities like attending the launch of the Black Rose Trust, aimed at funding a statue in Philip's honor. Philip's mother, who, despite still grieving her son's loss, welcomed me warmly. She even prepared a pasta dish for us to share and gave me a tour of their home, pointing out cherished items like awards Philip won to gifts, gifted by Paul McCartney and gold discs. My head was in a spin and stop spinning after that. My Timmy and Philomena Rest In Peace.

From that day forward, my friendship with Philip's family led to countless stories and experiences. Despite the passage of time, my passion for Philip and Thin Lizzy remains as fervent as it was when I was a teenager, discovering their music for the first time.
